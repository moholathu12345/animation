        <h2>Plan – Perform – Monitor – Reflect</h2>
        <div class="reflection-block">
          <h3>Plan</h3>
          <p>When I first started this project, I didn't really have a plan beyond "learn Blender and make something." However, I realised by Week 3 that animation doesn’t reward improvisation. It rewards structure. I broke the project into phases: learn basics, create key poses, refine timing, polish lighting and camera, then render. I didn’t always follow the timeline perfectly, but having that structure kept me grounded when things got messy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="reflection-block">
          <h3>Perform</h3>
          <p>The "doing" part was messy and non-linear. Some days I would stare blankly at my rig, trying to manipulate its actions, other days I'd be working long and hard creating the keyframes and joining them together. I learned that animation, is iteration. There's no "right way" for things to be done, and you learn from every mistake.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="reflection-block">
          <h3>Monitor</h3>
          <p>I got into the habit of recording short playblasts at the end of each session and comparing them to the previous version. This became my main way of monitoring progress. I could literally see the animation getting better over time — the movements becoming smoother, the timing tighter, the character more alive. I also kept a simple log noting what I worked on, what problems I hit, and what I'd tackle next. Looking back at those notes now is fascinating — I can see my understanding deepening week by week.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="reflection-block">
          <h3>Reflect</h3>
          <p>The biggest shift wasn’t technical. It was perceptual. At the start, animation meant moving objects from A to B. Now, I see it as telling a story through timing. </p>

  <!-- What Changed -->
  <section class="section section-alt">
    <div class="container narrow">
      <div class="fade-in-up">
        <h2>What changed in my understanding of animation</h2>
        <p>Before this project, I thought animation was about making things move. Now I understand it's about making things <em>feel</em>. The twelve principles of animation aren't just techniques — they're a language for communicating emotion, weight, energy, and personality through movement.</p>
        <p>I started by thinking in terms of "move the arm from here to here." By the end, I was thinking about anticipation, follow-through, weight shift, and emotional arcs. The biggest shift was understanding that <strong>timing is everything</strong>. The exact same poses with different timing can convey completely different moods — urgency vs. calm, power vs. grace, comedy vs. drama.</p>
        <p>I also didn't expect to learn so much about cinematography and lighting. Animation isn't just about the character's performance; it's about how you present that performance to the audience. Camera angles, lighting mood, and editing rhythm all work together to tell the story.</p>

  <!-- Biggest Challenges -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container narrow">
      <div class="fade-in-up">
        <h2>Biggest challenges and how I overcame them</h2>

        <div class="challenge-item">
          <h3>1. The Graph Editor learning curve</h3>
          <p>The Graph Editor was the single most intimidating part of Blender for me. All those curves, handles, and tangent types were overwhelming at first. I overcame this by working with simple examples first — animating a bouncing ball before touching the character rig. Once I understood what each curve shape meant in terms of real movement, it clicked. By Week 10, the Graph Editor was my favourite tool.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="challenge-item">
          <h3>2. Making movement feel natural</h3>
          <p>My early animations all looked robotic. Characters moved but they didn't feel alive. The breakthrough came when I understood overlapping action and follow-through — the idea that different body parts move at different rates. Once I started offsetting the timing of the head, shoulders, and hips, everything started looking more organic. Watching real dance reference in slow motion helped enormously.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="challenge-item">
          <h3>3. Scope management</h3>
          <p>I wanted to do too much. My original plan was a 2-minute animation with multiple camera angles and environmental effects. Reality forced me to scope down to 30 seconds with simpler staging. This felt like a failure at first, but the scoped-down version was better because I could polish every detail. Lesson: ambitious plans need realistic execution.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="challenge-item">
          <h3>4. Render time frustration</h3>
          <p>My first full render attempt took hours and came out noisy. I had to learn about optimising render settings, using denoising, and balancing quality with practical time constraints. This taught me that technical knowledge of the pipeline is just as important as artistic skill.</p>

  <!-- TP Attributes -->
  <section class="section section-alt">
    <div class="container narrow">
      <div class="fade-in-up">
        <h2>How this project developed key attributes</h2>

        <div class="attribute-block">
          <h3>Resilient</h3>
          <p>There were multiple points where I wanted to give up or start over. Week 4's walk cycle disaster, Week 8's timing struggles, and the 14-hour failed render were all moments where frustration peaked. Each time, I stepped back, broke the problem into smaller pieces, and found a path forward. The walk cycle eventually worked because I isolated and fixed each joint separately instead of trying to fix everything at once. The failed render taught me to always do test renders at lower resolution first. Resilience, I've learned, isn't about not failing — it's about having strategies for when you do.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="attribute-block">
          <h3>Inquisitive</h3>
          <p>Every problem in this project sent me down a learning rabbit hole. When my poses looked stiff, I researched the "line of action" principle. When my camera work felt off, I studied cinematography techniques from film analysis videos. When music sync felt sluggish, I learned about anticipation in animation. I didn't just fix problems — I tried to understand <em>why</em> they happened and what fundamental principle I was missing. This curiosity-driven approach meant each fix also deepened my understanding of the craft.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="attribute-block">
          <h3>Communicates Effectively</h3>
          <p>Building this portfolio itself demonstrates communication. I had to take a complex, 17-week technical project and present it in a way that's engaging and understandable. In my weekly entries, I focused on honest storytelling rather than technical jargon. During interview prep, I practiced distilling the entire journey into a 10-minute narrative with clear takeaways. I also communicated with peers during the process, sharing work-in-progress clips for feedback and learning to incorporate criticism constructively rather than defensively.</p>

  <!-- What I'd Improve -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container narrow">
      <div class="fade-in-up">
        <h2>What I would improve next time</h2>
        <ul class="improve-list">
          <li><strong>Test render earlier and more often.</strong> I waited too long to do full renders, which meant discovering problems late in the process.</li>
          <li><strong>Seek feedback earlier.</strong> I worked in isolation for too long. Getting eyes on my work in the blocking stage would have saved significant rework time.</li>
          <li><strong>Learn compositing from the start.</strong> Post-processing made a huge difference to the final output, but I only discovered it in Week 13. Knowing this earlier would have informed my lighting and rendering approach.</li>
          <li><strong>Spend more time on secondary animation.</strong> The main body movement works well, but the fingers and arms could use more detailing, made the dance look more robotic. </li>
        </ul>
